# MBTA LED Map

A simple and fast way to know when your train will arrive.


## Background

My product modifies the existing MBTA full subway map by incorporating LED
lights into the stops on the map that update in real time with the true vehicle
positions of the trains. I saw a need for a solution like this through my own
experience riding the T; I noticed that at some of the larger transfer stations
(such as Government Center or Park Street) many passengers would make a mad dash
out of the door of their train, often elbowing others on their way, in order to
hurry to the next platform in fear of potentially missing their next train if
they had not rushed. Additionally, Northeastern University (where I attend
school) is equidistant between both Ruggles and the Northeastern Green Line
stops, and almost every time I needed to go Downtown I've pulled out my phone
and loaded up a MBTA-tracking app to see which line would arrive first. My
product aims to help in both of these situations: riders at larger transfer
stations could glance at an improved map as they are leaving their train to see
if sprinting up the stairs would be really worth it, as could I as I am leaving
my apartment to see which line I should go to.


I had two primary goals when designing my product, which I believe that I have
accomplished: being more 'efficient' than the currently existing solutions
(faster while communicating more information) and being accessible to as many
riders of the T as I could be. The two main current solutions that I had
identified were the countdown clocks already in T stations and smartphone apps
that show the T data in realtime. My two greatest issues with these solutions
came down to my efficiency and accessibility goals: countdown clocks only show
the next two trains for a given line, and smartphone apps are only useful to
riders that have smartphones with good enough reception to work down in the
depths of the subway tunnels. My map fulfills both of these goals of mine, as it
shows all of the train positions by using the same map that every rider is sure
to have seem before and be familiar with, and does not assume any requirements
from the rider- the information is displayed for anyone who can physically see
it.
